X-axis 24 hour test over the CAN bus: go back and forth between two
positions and take a photo at each visit.

Version for the rotational encoder: an open-loop run does not use the
firmware's encoder calibration, see below. 24hrstest_can_linear.py is the
version the linear (magnetic) encoder runs were made with.

Same test as 24hrstest.py, but the PC is connected to the USB port of the
CAN MASTER and the X axis + encoder sit on a CAN slave (--node, default 11).
Moves go through the master's /motor_act (the master forwards them as SDO
writes), everything else is read and written in the slave's object
dictionary through the master's SDO bridge
({"task": "/can_act", "sdo": {...}}): position 0x2001, running 0x2004,
measured 0x2040, posErr 0x2041, axis mode 0x2042, health 0x2043,
fault 0x2044, calibrated 0x2046, calibrate 0x2048, counts per step 0x2049,
backlash 0x204A, raw counts 0x204B.
--status only prints the axis status read over CAN and does not move.

Two absolute positions are given: --slide-pos (the calibration slide) and
--sample-pos (the sample). Every --interval seconds
(default 10 min) the axis moves to the other position and a photo is taken
there, for --hours hours (default 24): calibration slide, sample, calibration slide, sample, ...
With the defaults that is 145 photos, 73 of the calibration slide and 72 of the sample.

All moves are done in --mode 0 (open loop) by default: the firmware does
not use the encoder, this script does the compensation with its own data.
The raw encoder count at the first arrival at each place is the reference
for that place. At every later arrival the count is compared with it
(encDriftCounts). If it is more than --comp-counts (5) counts off, all X
targets are shifted by the missing steps (offsetSteps), the axis backs off
--preload steps towards the place it came from and approaches again, so the
backlash stays the same; this is repeated up to --comp-tries (3) times
(compSteps = what was added at this visit, residualCounts = what is left).
The steps per count come from our own references (the travel between the two
places divided by the counts between them). --no-compensate only records.

An open-loop run only compares the step counter (0x2001) with the raw
encoder count (0x204B). The firmware's calibration and what it derives from
it (measured, posErr) are not used: they are only recorded in the CSV. No
calibration has to be run. Until both references are taken the steps per
count are --steps-per-count; without it the first (slow) leg gives the
ratio (the encoder only has to move) and the leg back is checked against it.

Lost steps: the encoder is trusted. A correction of more than --lost-steps
(2000) steps means the motor stalled during the move while the step counter
ran on without it. It is compensated like any other error, but slowly and
checked: at --recover-speed (10000), in chunks of --recover-chunk (5000)
steps up to the approach point. After every chunk the encoder must have seen
the steps; at the first chunk it does not follow nothing more is sent and
the run ends (so a jammed stage or a dead encoder is pushed one chunk at
most). The run also ends if the place is still more than --lost-steps off
after the recovery, or if an SDO read or a move fails during it. What happened
is printed and recorded in the row of that visit: event = LOST_STEPS,
xMoveStart / xMoveSec (when the move started and how long it took),
lostSteps and travelledPct (how much of the move is missing), stallRawCounts
and stallPos (where the stage stopped: encoder count and step position),
stallAfterSec / stallAfterSteps (the last sample taken during the move at
which the encoder still followed the step counter), compTries, compSpeed,
compSteps, residualCounts and offsetSteps (how it was compensated). The
samples taken during the lost move and the state after every recovery chunk
(time, step counter, encoder) go to <csv name>_lost_steps.csv.
The first leg to each place is driven at --recover-speed too: that arrival
is the encoder reference of the place, so there is no count yet to
compensate to. If the encoder did not see the steps of that leg, X goes back
to where the leg started (that count is known) in checked chunks and the leg
is driven once more; a second failure ends the run. After a run with
lost-step events the firmware's step counter
is off by offsetSteps. An open-loop run zeroes the encoder at the calibration
slide before its first leg; at the end of the run, back at the calibration slide,
the firmware sets the step counter from the encoder again (a few counts from its zero,
so the value of its calibration does not matter, but there must be one), and
the script checks the counter afterwards. If that did not work or the run
ended somewhere else (error, Ctrl+C), the offset, our steps per count and
the count of the calibration slide are noted in 24hrstest_can_rotational_x_unsynced.json and
the next run refuses to start: --resync then brings X back to the calibration
slide by the encoder (slowly, in checked chunks, with the noted values or
--steps-per-count / --resync-raw), has the step counter set from the encoder
there, checks it, removes the note and exits.
The run only ends when the first arrival at a place (its reference) did not
follow the steps, when a single correction is above --max-comp steps
(default: 1.1 x the travel between the two places, more cannot be lost in
one move), when the total is above --max-offset steps, or when the place is
still not reached after --comp-tries corrections. The row of that visit is
written before the run ends.
Modes 1 = monitor, 2 = correct, 3 = servo are available, but the firmware's
watchdog stops the axis in all three once posErr passes its lag limit, see
below. In modes 2 and 3 the firmware adopts the encoder
position as the new step counter after every move, so compare
"measured"/"commanded" there, not rawCounts.

Where the two places are: they are given as step positions (SLIDE_XYZ and
SAMPLE_XYZ, or the command line) and are used as they are. Nothing of an
earlier run is used: the first photo of a place in this run is its
reference (24hrstest_shift.py), the encoder count at the first arrival its
encoder reference. Before the first leg an open-loop run goes to the calibration slide
position (from the sample side, like every later arrival) and zeroes the
encoder there (the encoder is incremental: it starts at 0 after every
power-up). The step counter is only right as long as no steps were lost
outside a run: teach the two places again if that is in doubt.

--slide-ref <photo> brings the calibration slide to where it is in a photo of
an earlier run instead: at the calibration slide position a photo is taken and compared
with it (cross correlation, the code of 24hrstest_shift.py). The shift
in px is converted into motor steps (px -> um with the tick period of the
ruler and --tick-um, um -> steps with --um-per-step; after the first
correction the px per step that this correction really gave are used) and
X is corrected until the picture is within --align-tol-um of the reference.
The steps that took are the start value of offsetSteps, so both places move
with it: the sample is the taught distance away from the calibration slide. The
encoder is zeroed at the aligned position. The photos are saved in
<csv name>_photos/align. The run ends before the first leg if the calibration
slide is not in the picture (correlation below --align-corr) or if more
than --align-max-um would be needed: then the counter is too far off, bring
X to the calibration slide by hand. Only X is corrected, dy is reported.

Calibration: modes 1..3 only work with a valid encoder calibration in the
firmware (sign, counts per step, backlash), otherwise "measured"/"posErr"
are wrong and CORRECT/SERVO move the axis to the wrong place. So with
--mode 1..3 the script first runs the firmware's calibration (SDO 0x2048 = 1:
the axis sweeps +5500 steps from where it is and back, the result is stored
in the slave), --no-calibrate skips it. Over CAN only the resulting counts
per step and backlash can be read back, not the fit quality.
After that the first leg (to the sample position) is run open loop (the
axis mode is set to 0 for this leg, there is no per-move override over CAN)
as a scale check: if posErr changes by more than --max-drift steps on it, a
closed-loop run is aborted there. In modes 1..3 the firmware's watchdog
stops the axis and latches LOST_STEPS as soon as posErr passes its lag limit
(about 136 steps), and posErr grows with the travel when the calibrated
counts per step are slightly off - over the ~296000 steps between the two
places that needs the scale to be right to about 0.03 %.

Safety, for an unattended run:
  - nothing moves before the camera and all three axes have answered and all
    targets passed the --limit / --z-limit checks;
  - the order is always X, then Y, then Z into focus (with a safe Z: Z
    retracts first); every move waits until the axis has stopped at its
    target before the next one starts. Z only ever goes to the two focus
    positions (and the safe Z, if set);
  - any SDO failure, move timeout or latched axis fault ends the run; the
    axes stay where they are, nothing is retried and no fault is cleared;
  - only a failed photo is skipped.

The two places are 3D positions (x, y, z), set as the constants SLIDE_XYZ
and SAMPLE_XYZ at the top of this file (the command line overrides them).
Y (--y-node, default 12) and the focus Z (--z-node, default 13) are further
CAN slaves, moved open loop (no encoder). At every visit: Z retracts to
SAFE_Z / --safe-z (if one is set), X moves, Y moves, Z goes to the focus of
that place, then the photo is taken. With a safe Z, Z is also retracted
before the calibration sweep and always comes into focus from the safe
position, so its backlash is the same at every photo. Without one, Z stays
in focus while X and Y move. After the last visit the stage goes back to the
calibration slide (x, y, z in focus), see --no-return-to-slide; if the run ends
early (error, Ctrl+C) the axes stay where they are.

Backlash: the calibration slide position is always approached from the sample position
and the other way round, also the very first time, so every photo of one
position is taken after the same leg.

The photos are taken with the Hikrobot camera (needs the MVS SDK installed,
and the MVS client must not have the camera open) and saved as
<csv name>_photos/calibration_slide/0000_calibration_slide_<time>.png and .../sample/0001_sample_<time>.png,
where 24hrstest_shift.py looks for them (the first photo of a place is its
reference). The gain is set to --gain (5 dB); the exposure etc. are used as
they are set in the camera. --photo-test only takes one photo, to check
the camera and the picture, and does not move the axis.
A full-size png is about 30 MB, so 24 h need about 5 GB of disk space.

The PC is kept awake while the script runs. Stop early with Ctrl+C.

Connect to the USB port of the CAN master.
