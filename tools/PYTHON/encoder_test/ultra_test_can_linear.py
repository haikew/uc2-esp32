X-axis ultra test over the CAN bus: the 24 hour test (back and forth between
two positions, a photo at each visit) with random X moves between the visits.

Version for the linear (magnetic) encoder: 24hrstest_can_linear.py with the
random moves added. The first legs and the start check rely on the firmware's
encoder calibration (counts per step, posErr); ultra_test_can_rotational.py
does not.

Random moves: between two visits X makes --walk-min .. --walk-max (2 .. 5)
moves to random positions, one after the other, at --speed (100000) and
--accel (1000000). The targets are drawn anywhere between the two places, so the
moves have any length up to the whole travel, but never leave the two
places: outside them X hits something. The targets keep --walk-margin (2000)
steps away from both places. After the last one X goes back to the place of
the last photo (the move "back" in <csv name>_walk.csv: X only, no photo),
waits there and leaves for the other place when the visit is due, so the leg
to a place is always the whole travel, as in the 24 hour test. A random move
that would not be over by then, with the way back, is left out. --seed makes
the same random moves again (it is printed and written to the CSV),
--dry-run only prints them.
After every random move the raw encoder count is compared with the count
that target has by the encoder references of the two places (errCounts in
<csv name>_walk.csv, one row per random move). That is only recorded: at
the place the count is compared with its reference again, and between the
places a few counts off need not be a position error (in the run of
2026-10-07 the linear encoder was up to 50 um off the straight line between
the two places in the middle of the travel; with the offset taken from that,
nearly every visit had to take the same steps out again).
--walk-comp-counts N takes the offset from the encoder when a random move
ends more than N counts off, so the next move starts from where the stage
really is (walkComp of a visit = the steps this added during the random
moves before it). Without it only a move that lost steps does that. X does
not approach the random target again.
The way back is handled like a random move; its count is compared with the
reference of that place (errCounts = how far off X arrived there).
More than --lost-steps (2000) steps off = the move lost steps: it is printed
and recorded like a lost-step event of a leg (in the row of the next visit,
walkLost = which move: i/n or back), no more moves are made in this interval
(X does not go back either), X waits where it stopped and goes to the place
when the visit is due, at
--recover-speed. That leg is sent by the step counter: without the offset
from the encoder it would end as far from the place as the counter is off -
beyond the place, if the steps were lost moving away from it.
The run ends without another move if the encoder count after a random move
is more than --walk-stop-counts (500) counts outside the counts of the two
places (from the count of the one place - 500 to the count of the other
+ 500): X must not leave them. Inside that range the run goes on.
walkMoves (done/planned) of a visit are the random moves before it,
walkTravel their steps and those of the way back.
The 24 h version is the default: a visit every 10 min for 24 h. --quick: a
visit every 60 s for half an hour. --interval and --hours override both.

Same test as 24hrstest.py, but the PC is connected to the USB port of the
CAN MASTER and the X axis + encoder sit on a CAN slave (--node, default 11).
Moves go through the master's /motor_act (the master forwards them as SDO
writes), everything else is read and written in the slave's object
dictionary through the master's SDO bridge
({"task": "/can_act", "sdo": {...}}): position 0x2001, running 0x2004,
measured 0x2040, posErr 0x2041, axis mode 0x2042, health 0x2043,
fault 0x2044, calibrated 0x2046, calibrate 0x2048, counts per step 0x2049,
backlash 0x204A, raw counts 0x204B.
--status only prints the axis status read over CAN and does not move.

Two absolute positions are given: --slide-pos (the calibration slide) and
--sample-pos (the sample). Every --interval seconds
(10 min, with --quick 60) the axis moves to the other position and a
photo is taken there, for --hours hours (24, with --quick 0.5): calibration slide,
sample, calibration slide, sample, ... With the defaults that is 145 photos, 73 of the
calibration slide and 72 of the sample; with --quick 31.

All moves are done open loop (--mode 0, the only mode of this test): the
firmware does not use the encoder, this script does the compensation with
its own data.
The raw encoder count at the first arrival at each place is the reference
for that place. At every later arrival the count is compared with it
(encDriftCounts). If it is more than --comp-counts (4) counts off, all X
targets are shifted by the missing steps (offsetSteps), the axis backs off
--preload steps towards the place it came from and approaches again, so the
backlash stays the same; this is repeated up to --comp-tries (3) times
(compSteps = what was added at this visit, residualCounts = what is left).
The steps per count come from our own references (the travel between the two
places divided by the counts between them), not from the firmware's
calibration. --no-compensate only records.

Lost steps: the encoder is trusted. A correction of more than --lost-steps
(2000) steps means the motor stalled during the move while the step counter
ran on without it. It is compensated like any other error, but slowly and
checked: at --recover-speed (10000), in chunks of --recover-chunk (5000)
steps up to the approach point. After every chunk the encoder must have seen
the steps; at the first chunk it does not follow nothing more is sent and
the run ends (so a jammed stage or a dead encoder is pushed one chunk at
most). The run also ends if the place is still more than --lost-steps off
after the recovery, or if an SDO read or a move fails during it. What happened
is printed and recorded in the row of that visit: event = LOST_STEPS,
xMoveStart / xMoveSec (when the move started and how long it took),
lostSteps and travelledPct (how much of the move is missing), stallRawCounts
and stallPos (where the stage stopped: encoder count and step position),
stallAfterSec / stallAfterSteps (the last sample taken during the move at
which the encoder still followed the step counter), compTries, compSpeed,
compSteps, residualCounts and offsetSteps (how it was compensated). The
samples taken during the lost move and the state after every recovery chunk
(time, step counter, encoder) go to <csv name>_lost_steps.csv.
The first leg to each place is driven at --recover-speed too: that arrival
is the encoder reference of the place, so there is no count yet to
compensate to. If the encoder did not see the steps of that leg, X goes back
to where the leg started (that count is known) in checked chunks and the leg
is driven once more; a second failure ends the run. After a run with
lost-step events the firmware's step counter
is off by offsetSteps; at the end of the run, back at the calibration slide, it is
set from the encoder again. If a run ended somewhere else (error, Ctrl+C),
the next run refuses to start (step counter and encoder disagree): --resync
then brings X back to the calibration slide by the encoder (raw count
--resync-raw, slowly, in checked chunks), sets the step counter from the
encoder there and exits.
The run only ends when the first arrival at a place (its reference) did not
follow the steps, when a single correction is above --max-comp steps
(default: 1.1 x the travel between the two places, more cannot be lost in
one move), when the total is above --max-offset steps, or when the place is
still not reached after --comp-tries corrections. The row of that visit is
written before the run ends.

Safety, for an unattended run:
  - nothing moves before the camera and all three axes have answered and all
    targets passed the --limit / --z-limit checks;
  - the order is always X, then Y, then Z into focus (with a safe Z: Z
    retracts first); every move waits until the axis has stopped at its
    target before the next one starts. Z only ever goes to the two focus
    positions (and the safe Z, if set);
  - any SDO failure, move timeout or latched axis fault ends the run; the
    axes stay where they are, nothing is retried and no fault is cleared;
  - only a failed photo is skipped.

The two places are 3D positions (x, y, z), set as the constants SLIDE_XYZ
and SAMPLE_XYZ at the top of this file (the command line overrides them).
Y (--y-node, default 12) and the focus Z (--z-node, default 13) are further
CAN slaves, moved open loop (no encoder). At every visit: Z retracts to
SAFE_Z / --safe-z (if one is set), X moves, Y moves, Z goes to the focus of
that place, then the photo is taken. With a safe Z, Z is also retracted
before the calibration sweep and always comes into focus from the safe
position, so its backlash is the same at every photo. Without one, Z stays
in focus while X and Y move. After the last visit the stage goes back to the
calibration slide (x, y, z in focus), see --no-return-to-slide; if the run ends
early (error, Ctrl+C) the axes stay where they are.

Backlash: the calibration slide position is always approached from the sample position
and the other way round, also the very first time, so every photo of one
position is taken after the same leg.

The photos are taken with the Hikrobot camera (needs the MVS SDK installed,
and the MVS client must not have the camera open) and saved as
<csv name>_photos/calibration_slide/0000_calibration_slide_<time>.png and .../sample/0001_sample_<time>.png,
where 24hrstest_shift.py looks for them (the first photo of a place is its
reference). Exposure, gain etc. are used as they are set in the
camera unless --gain is given. --photo-test only takes one photo, to check
the camera and the picture, and does not move the axis.
A full-size png is about 30 MB, so 24 h need about 5 GB of disk space.

The PC is kept awake while the script runs. Stop early with Ctrl+C.

Connect to the USB port of the CAN master.
